# Grid Experiments Results

This directory contains the results obtained by training our models using knowledge distillation on different tasks.

To generate these kind of files you have to run the scripts:
- shell_scripts/run_qa_kd_experiments.sh
- shell_scripts/run_seq_kd_experiments.sh
- shell_scripts/run_token_kd_experiments.sh

The models uploaded to the HuggingFace are the ones with least loss of those logged in these files.
